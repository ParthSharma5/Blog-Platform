## What is Cloud Computing?


Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet.

In essence of instead of buying physical infrastructure like servers,computer,managing a physical area to protect and manage this infrastructure **We simply rent and access these infrastructures eg aws,cloud,gcp etc**

**Using someone else's infrastructure They have the headache of managing and maintaining it**.

**The power to deploy databases,virtual machines,network etc at the click of a button**

**You lower your costs, the infrastructure runs more efficiently and scale as per your need**

### Advantages of Cloud Computing ?

1.**Trade fixed expenses for variable expenses:-** Pay only for the resources you use and you don't need to do investments in infrastructure.

2.**Benefit from massive economies of scale:-** Cloud providers offers lower costs through aggregated usage from many customers.

3.**Stop guessing capacity:-** Scale up resources or down as needed without overprovisioning or limitations.

4.**Increase speed and agility:-** Deploy IT resources in minutes, reducing time & costs for development

5.**Stop spending money running and maintaining data centres:-** Focus on innovation and customers instead of infrastructure management.

6.**Go Global in minutes:-** Deploy application worldwide quickly for better performance.

## What is Scalability ?

```
The ability to adjust resources to meet demand
1. Peak traffic  ? Add more resources
2. Less traffic ? Shut down resources
3. You only pay what you use

```

## What is Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up) ?

```
It involves increasing the capacity of existing nodes/machines
For example If a server requires more processing power vertical scaling
involves upgrading the CPU's Similarly storage can be dynamically upgraded or
degraded

```

## What is Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out) ?

```
When you need to handle new demand Horizontal scaling involves adding more nodes
machines to your infrastructure
if a application is hosted on a server is struggling to manage traffic due to the
lack of capacity or capability .The solution may be add to another server.
